Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It performs three main functions:

Domain Registration: You can register domain names directly through Route 53.
DNS Routing: It translates domain names like example.com into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.
Health Checking: Route 53 can monitor the health of your resources and route traffic to healthy endpoints
